# 🙂 Basic Information About Me

## Who Am I? 🤨
Hello! My name is **"Koon"** (pronounced: goon).

## The Origin of the Name "Koon2120" 🖋
The name **"Koon2120"** comes from **"Koon"**, my nickname, and the number **2120**, which used to be my student ID back in elementary school (well, not exactly, but it stuck with me and I’ve used it ever since). I chose this name because I wanted something unique and recognizable—kind of like a brand name.

## Interests 💭
I have a wide range of interests, but my greatest passion lies in Coding (Web Development, Game Development) and being a Game Creator—something I’ve aspired to be since I was around 14 or 15 years old. Thanks to my involvement in the gaming world, my curiosity and passion have only grown stronger.

I’m also deeply interested in Websites and Web Applications, which has led me to explore various roles such as Web Designer, UX/UI Designer, Front-end & Back-end Developer, and more.

## Memorable Experiences 📝
- Co-managed online communities for various games, which gave me the chance to meet new people and gain valuable experience.
- Helped run multiple Facebook pages of different themes, creating content in forms such as images, texts, and videos.
- Built a variety of websites and web applications—from simple systems to complex platforms.
- Developed many types of games and deepened my knowledge in game development across various aspects.

## Final Thoughts
Even though I still have much to learn and practice, I’m committed to improving myself and staying inspired. I’ve faced a fair share of challenges and gained a lot of experience, but there’s still much I haven’t encountered yet. Still, I plan to learn from every experience and keep growing, always pushing forward to gain new insights and skills.

I hope that I can contribute positively to society through my knowledge and experiences, no matter how big or small, and continue creating fun and meaningful content for others.
